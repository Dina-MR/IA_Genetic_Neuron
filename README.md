# IA_Genetic_Neuron

Welcome to Chicken Race Simulator ! It's a projet made for Gamagora's AI courses.
The goal was to implement genetic algorithms.

Here, I make multiple chicken run in a playground until they reach the goal (the golden eggs)... or they fall.
Each generations after the first is made in a way that makes chicken more clever when choosing which direction to take.
